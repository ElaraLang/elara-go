# Elara Programming Language Specification

## Chapter 0 - Grammar Syntax

This specification uses a modified form of
[ANTLR4 Grammar Syntax](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/index.md)
to describe the grammar of Elara.

In many cases, natural language may be used instead of a
strictly ANTLR-compliant syntax for the sake of simplicity.

Literal patterns (for example a pattern matching the character sequence `/*`)
should have their characters separated by spaces
(the previous example becomes `/ *`).

## Chapter 1 - Lexical Structure

### 1.1 - Unicode

Elara programs are encoded in the [Unicode character set](https://unicode.org)
and almost all Unicode characters are supported in source code.

Elara Source Code should either be encoded in a UTF-8 or UTF-16 format.

### 1.2 - Line Terminators

Elara recognises 3 different options for line terminator characters:
`CR`, `LF`, or `CR` immediately followed by `LF`.

Each of these patterns are treated as 1 single line terminator.
These are used to determine when expressions start and end,
and will determine line numbers in errors produced.

```antlr
LineTerminator:
    | The ASCII CR Character
    | The ASCII LF Character
    | The ASCII CR Character immediately followed by the ASCII LF Character
```

### 1.3 - Whitespace

```antlr
WhiteSpace:
    | The ASCII SP Character, ` `
    | The ASCII HT Character, `\t`
    | LineTerminator

InputCharacter: Any Unicode Character except WhiteSpace
```

### 1.4 - Comments

Comment Properties:

- Comments cannot be nested
- 1 comment type's syntax has no special meaning in another comment
- Comments do not apply in string literals

Elara uses 2 main formats for comments:

#### Single Line Comments

Single line comments are denoted with the literal text `//`.
Any source code following from this pattern until a **Line Terminator**
character is encountered is ignored.

```antlr
SingleLineComment:
    / / InputCharacter+
```

#### Multi line comments

Multi line comments start with `/*` and continue until `*/` is encountered.
If no closing comment is found (i.e `EOF` is reached before a `*/`),
an error should be raised by the compiler.

```antlr
StartMultiLineComment: / *

EndMultiLineComment: * /

MultiLineComment: StartMultiLineComment InputCharacter+ EndMultiLineComment
```

### 1.5 - Normal Identifiers

Identifiers are unlimited length sequences of any of the following characters:

- Any characters of the alphabet, upper or lower case
- Any denary digit

Additionally, a valid identifier must satisfy all of the following:

- Must start with a character that is **NOT** a digit (i.e 0-9)
- Must not directly match any reserved Elara keywords

```antlr
IdentifierCharacter: Any characters of the latin alphabet, upper or lowercase

IdentifierCharacterOrDigit: IdentifierCharacter or 0-9

Identifier: IdentifierCharacter IdentifierCharacterOrDigit+ but not a Keyword
```

#### 1.5.1 - Type vs Binding Identifiers

If an identifier starts with an uppercase character,
it is implied to be referencing a type's identifier.

On the other hand, starting with lowercase implies a "binding" identifier
(that is, referring to some named expression)

This means that all type names must start with uppercase
(excluding generics), and all bindings must start with lowercase.

### 1.6 Operator Identifiers

Elara supports custom operators and operator overloading.
A separate type of identifier is defined for these.
These identifiers may only consist of the following symbols:

#### Valid Operator Symbols

- `.`
- `>`
- `<`
- `=`
- `-`
- `/`
- `+`
- `*`
- `&`
- `|`
- `!`
- `?`
- `%`
- `^`
- `:`
- `~`
- `#`
- `_`
- `\`

Additionally, they must not match any of the following patterns:

- `=`
- `/*` or `*/`
- `//`

When referenced in any context apart from infix application,
the operator's identifier must also be surrounded in parentheses.
For example, to define an operator `/=` we do

```fsharp
let (/=) x y = [implementation]
```

```antlr
InvalidOperatorSymbol:
    | =
    | / *
    | * /
    | / /

OperatorSymbol: Any character described in "Valid Operator Symbols" except InvalidOperatorSymbol

QualifiedOperator: ( UnqualifiedOperator )

UnqualifiedOperator: OperatorSymbol+
```

### 1.7 - Number Literals

Number Literals are unlimited sequences of numeric characters.

For clarity, any number literals may contain `_` which can be used in place of
a comma or dot in real world numbers. These should be ignored by the lexer and
do not affect the resultant number in any way.
For example, the literal `21_539` is functionally identical to `21539`

Number Literals are translated to values of some type implementing
the `Num` type class. That is, all number literals are polymorphic by default.

```antlr
DecimalDigit: 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9

BinaryDigit: 0 | 1

HexadecimalDigit: DecimalDigit | a | b | c | d | e | f | A | B | C | D | E | F

Separator: _

DecimalLiteral: (DecimalDigit | Separator)+

HexadecimalPrefix: 0x

HexadecimalLiteral: HexadecimalPrefix (HexadecimalDigit | Separator)+

BinaryPrefix: 0b

BinaryLiteral: BinaryPrefix (BinaryDigit | Separator)+

FloatingPointSeparator: .

FloatingPoint: DecimalLiteral FloatingPointSeparator DecimalLiteral
```

#### 1.7.1 - Integer Literals

##### 1.7.1.1 - Decimal Integer Literals

Decimal Integer Literals follow a base-10 notation and
so any characters between `0` and `9` are accepted.

##### 1.7.1.2 - Hexadecimal Integer Literals

Hexadecimal Integer Literals represent numbers in a base-16 format.
Any number literal directly preceeded by a `0x` sequence of characters
should be treated as hexadecimal.
Any characters between `0` and `9`, along with upper or lowercase letters
between `a` and `f` are accepted.

##### 1.7.1.3 - Binary Integer Literals

These represent numbers in a base-2 format. Any number literal directly preceeded
by a `0b` sequence of characters should be treated as binary.
These only accept 2 characters: `0` and `1`

#### 1.7.2 - Floating Point Literals

Floating point literals represent numbers with a decimal point.

Only base-10 notation is supported in floating points.
That is, Hexadecimal and Binary floats are illegal and should
raise a compiler error if a `.` is encountered.

### 1.8 - Character Literals

```antlr
EscapeSequence:
    | \ b (backspace character, Unicode \u0008)
    | \ s (space character, Unicode \u0020)
    | \ h (horizontal tab, Unicode \u0009)
    | \ n (newline LF, Unicode \u000a)
    | \ f (form feed FF, Unicode \u000c)
    | \ r (carriage return CR, Unicode \u000d)
    | \ " (double quote ")
    | \ ' (single quote ')
    | \ \ (backslash \)
    | UnicodeEscape

UnicodeEscape: \ u {HexadecimalDigit, 4}

CharacterLiteralValue: EscapeSequence | Any Raw Unicode character

CharacterLiteral: ' CharacterLiteralValue '
```

It is a compile time error for a character literal to contain
more than 1 `CharacterLiteralValue` in between the single quotes,
or for a `LineTerminator` character to appear between the quotes.

`UnicodeEscape` values may only represent UTF-16 code units.
They are limited to `\u0000` to `\uffff`.

Character literals are converted to values of the `Char` type.

### 1.9 - String Literals

A String Literal consists of zero or more characters
surrounded by double quotes (`"`).
Special characters (such as newlines) must be represented
as escapes, rather than their literal values.

```antlr
StringCharacter:
    | Any Unicode Character except [", \]
    | EscapeSequence

StringLiteral: " StringCharacter+ "
```

If any Line Terminator Character appears between the opening and closing `"`
, an compiler error will be thrown.

String literals are translated to values of the `[Char]` type (a list of `Char`s).

### 1.10 - Text Blocks

A Text Block ("Multiline String") consists of zero or more characters
surrounded by 3 double quotes (`"""`). Similar to String Literals,
special characters must be represented with escape sequences.

```antlr
TextBlockCharacter:
    | Any Unicode Character except \
    | EscapeSequence

TextBlock: " " " TextBlockCharacter+ " " "
```

The output of a Text Block should trim any consistent indentation
at compile time, and replace raw `LineTerminator` characters with
their corresponding escape sequences. For example, the following code:

```fsharp
let message = """
    hello
    world
    """
```

should be translated to a normal String Literal equivalent to the following: `"\nhello\nworld\n"`

#### 1.10.1 - Raw Text Blocks

If the indentation trimming functionality of a standard Text Block
is not desired, we can use a Raw Text Block.
These are defined as zero or more characters directly preceeded by
`!"""` and directly terminated by `"""!`.

They behave identically to normal text blocks,
except not attempting to trim any indentation.

Adjusting the previous example to use a raw text block gives:

```fsharp
let message = !"""
    hello
    world
    """!
```

Which translates to the string literal `"\n    hello\n    world\n"`

### 1.11 - Keywords

Keywords are special sequences of characters that are  allowed as a
standard identifier. They should also generally be treated as separate tokens.

The following sequences of characters are reserved as keywords
and are not permitted for use as identifiers:

- `let`
- `def`
- `type`
- `in`
- `where`
- `class`
- `instance`
- `if`
- `else`
- `then`

## Chapter 2 - Parser and Grammar

### 2.1 - Bindings

Bindings can be declared anywhere in a source file with the following syntax:

```fsharp
    let [identifier] = [value]
```

Bindings declared in this form are accessible from anywhere in the code
that is after the binding declaration, and in the same, or a child scope.

Bindings are **NOT** expressions, and so they cannot be recursively defined.

#### 2.1.1 - Verbose Binding Syntax

An alternative binding form is provided that **is** an expression:

```fsharp
    let [identifier] = [value] in [expression]
```

In this form, the binding is only present in the scope of `expression`.
The entire construct evaluates to the result of `expression`.

#### 2.1.2 - Binding Type Declarations

Bindings can optionally declare an expected type of their value.

This is done with a colon (`:`) after the `[identifier]` section
followed by the expected type.

For example:

```fsharp
    let [identifier]: [Type] = [value]
```

If `value` (or `expression`) does not evaluate to a value of type `Type`,
a compiler error should be raised.

### 2.2 - Functions

The syntax for defining functions is very similar to bindings,
however function definitions also define the parameters of the function.

```fsharp
    let [identifier] [param1] [param2] [...] = [function_body]
```

where `param1`, `param2`, ... `paramN` are valid [Identifiers](#15---normal-identifiers)
and `function_body` is any expression.

For example:

```fsharp
   let f param1 param2 = param1 + param2
```

#### 2.2.1 - Multiple Expression Function Bodies

Functions can also have multiple expressions in their body.
This is denoted by a new line, and then indentation, so that every line of
the body lines up with the function name.

For example:

```fsharp
    let f param1 param2 =
        print param1
        print param2
        let double = param1 * 2
        double + param2
```

Every line in the body is evaluated, and the last line is returned.
Therefore, a function body must end with an expression.

##### 2.2.1.1 - Semicolons in Multiple Expression Function Bodies

Semicolons (`;`) can also be used as an alternative or supplement to line terminators:

```fsharp
    let f param1 param2 =
        print param1 ; print param2
        let double = param1 * 2
        double + param2
```

#### 2.2.2 - Def forms

It is often useful to explicitly specify the type of a function,
for drafting out implementations or for readability in future.

Whilst the let binding colon syntax can be used for functions, it is often messy.
For example:

```fsharp
    let add a b : Int -> Int -> Int = a + b
```

To avoid this issue, the type of the function can be declared on the line above
its implementation.

```fsharp
    def [identifier] : [type]
```

For example:

```fsharp
    def add : Int -> Int -> Int
    let add a b = a + b
```

This form can also be used for standard bindings (i.e not functions):

```fsharp
    def pi : Double
    let pi = 3.141529
```

The def line must be directly above the let line
